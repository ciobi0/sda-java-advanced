 * Create a shop imitating application .
 * Create Basket class that will allow for adding , removing and retrieving all items in the basket.
 * Each item is an instance of Product interface that defines two methods ,
 * -one to get price of an item and
 * -one to check for availability based on a provided date
 *
 * Create GenericProduct class that implements Product interface and will have supplier
 * supplying price and function checking availability based on a provided date for a particular product
 *
 * Make sure that Basket does not expose its internal list storing products ( meaning it will
 * not return a reference to its internal list but rather a copy ), all operations on that list
 * should be done through Basket methods.
